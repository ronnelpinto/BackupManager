This project aims to make a Backup manager for Linux using Python3.

The project aims to develop a Backup manager which will give the user option to backup a particular directory to another drive or folder.
They can also select the files to backup and thus it provides more flexibility.
The backed up files are stored in compressed and stored in the backup folder
Plan to also make a GUI for the user to interact with the backup manager.
